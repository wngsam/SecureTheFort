# SecureTheFort

A graphic-less game where you play the role of an overseer of a castle that must hire soldiers, recruit peasants and upgrade infrastructures
to fight enemies.

Simple functions include:

-Fighting (With different combat options that operate differently. Enemies are generated depending on your stats.)

-View Stats (And the ability to add stats to enhance your combat capabilities.)

-Shop (Purchase soldiers, peasants, investments and upgrades.)

-Gamble (Gamble for double or nothing in a game of heads or tails or purchase a chance to win big in a lottery-like feature.)

-Game also saves on exit using Java I/O stream libaries.
